Bruteforce
Bruteforce is a Python script designed for password cracking by generating all possible combinations of characters until the correct password is found. This script can be used for educational purposes or on systems where the user has forgotten their password.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your system.

Usage
To use the script, simply run the following command in the terminal:

`python script.py`

You will then be prompted to enter the password hash and the character set to use for generating the combinations. The script will then start generating all possible combinations until the correct password is found.
